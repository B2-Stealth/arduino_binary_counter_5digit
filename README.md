ARDUINO BINARY COUNTER FOR LAST 5 DIGITS
This is my code for a simple infinite binary counter that shows the last 5 digits of the number

I have simply used bitwise operations to get it working.
I am basically accessing the binary version of my input, which I have copied to a variable to avoid unwanted side-effects.

You can easily form the connections in Arduino, using an Uno board, 5 LEDs, jumper wires, and a breadboard, and ofcourse, 
don't forget the resistors(to avoid exploding the LEDs!)
Or
You can use tinkercad
