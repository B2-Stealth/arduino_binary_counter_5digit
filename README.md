# ARDUINO BINARY COUNTER FOR LAST 5 DIGITS 

This is my code for a simple infinite binary counter that shows the last 5 digits of the number

I have simply used bitwise operations to get it working.
I am basically accessing the binary version of my input, which I have copied to a variable to avoid unwanted side-effects.
